# Login system with database using SQLAlchemy

If the user gets the password wrong more than 3 times, they will be unable to log in for 1 minute  
Project Step by Step:
 - [ ] 1. Make the front that asks for login and password 
 - [ ] 2. Perform functions that perform queries on the database
 - [ ] 3. Create the code that logs into the system or does not allow login for 1 minute

 After that the project can be finished
